## 🚀 What is BranchGPT?

Ever wished you could explore "what if" scenarios in your AI chats?  
**BranchGPT** lets you do just that!  
Branch, revisit, and manage multiple conversation threads—all in a beautiful, local-first app.

> **Why?**  
> One weekend, the idea of branching a conversation struck me.  
> I wanted to see how different prompts or replies would change the flow—without losing my original thread.  
> So, I built BranchGPT!

## 🛡️ Privacy & How It Works

- **No backend. No servers. No snooping.**
- All AI responses are generated by making direct API calls to OpenAI using **your own API key**.
- Your API key is **securely stored and encrypted** on your device only.
- **All conversations and branches are saved locally** alongside the app data.
- You can clear your data at any time from within the app.

## ✨ Features

- **Branch any conversation** at any point—explore alternate realities!
- **All data stays on your device** (privacy-first).
- **No account required**—just your OpenAI API key.
- **Modern, clean UI** for a smooth chat experience.
